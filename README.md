# Graphql-Assessment

Frontend - React
Backend - Graphql

I decided to create my own graphql mock up api. to run it install dependencies using 'npm install' and 'npm run start' to start the server. I created my graphql 
connections inside the app.js and graphql folder inside src to define fields. A few libraries i used react-icons, lodash.debounce, framer-motion. I created my
components and view folder. The app was broken down into components with each individual component in the components folder. i created a helper folder and functions 
i intend to reuse where placed there. I made a copy of data which was then used for filter and search. Edge cases like filter by two parameters and searching through
filter list was taken care of. The experience is smooth and fast however if i was to improve on it i would improve on the UI.
